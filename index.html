        <p style="color:black; font-size: larger; font-weight: bolder;">The history of film chronicles the development of a visual art
            form created using film technologies that
            began in the late 19th century. <br><br>

            The advent of film as an artistic medium is not clearly defined. There were earlier cinematographic
            screenings by others, however, the commercial, public screening of ten Lumière brothers' short films in
            Paris on 28 December 1895, can be regarded as the breakthrough of projected cinematographic motion pictures.
            The earliest films were in black and white, under a minute long, without recorded sound, and consisted of a
            single shot from a steady camera. The first decade saw film move from a novelty, to an established mass
            entertainment industry, with film production companies and studios established throughout the world.
            Conventions toward a general cinematic language developed, with film editing, camera movements and other
            cinematic techniques contributing specific roles in the narrative of films. <br><br>

            Popular new media, including television (mainstream since the 1950s), home video (1980s), and the internet
            (1990s), influenced the distribution and consumption of films. Film production usually responded with
            content to fit the new media, and technical innovations (including widescreen (1950s), 3D, and 4D film) and
            more spectacular films to keep theatrical screenings attractive. Systems that were cheaper and more easily
            handled (including 8mm film, video, and smartphone cameras) allowed for an increasing number of people to
            create films of varying qualities, for any purpose including home movies and video art. The technical
            quality was usually lower than professional movies, but improved with digital video and affordable,
            high-quality digital cameras. Improving over time, digital production methods became more popular during the
            1990s, resulting in increasingly realistic visual effects and popular feature-length computer animations.
            <br><br>

            Various film genres have emerged during the history of film, and enjoyed variable degrees of success.

            <td style="color:black">At the start of the First World War, French and Italian cinema had been the most
                globally popular. The
                war came as a devastating interruption to European film industries. <br><br>

                Throughout the early 20th century, screen artists continued to learn how to work with cameras and create
                illusions using space and time in their shots. This newly introduced form of creativity made way for a
                whole new group of people to be introduced to stardom, including David W. Griffith, who made a name for
                himself with his 1915 film, The Birth of a Nation. In 1920, there were two major changes to the film
                industry: the introduction of sound and the creation of studio systems. In the 1920s, talent who had
                been working independently began joining studios and working with other actors and directors. In 1927,
                The Jazz Singer was released, bringing sound to the motion picture industry.</td>

            <td style="color:black">The German cinema, marked by those times, saw the era of the German Expressionist
                film movement. Berlin
                was its center with the Filmstudio Babelsberg.[91][92] The first Expressionist films made up for a lack
                of lavish budgets by using set designs with wildly non-realistic, geometrically absurd angles, along
                with designs painted on walls and floors to represent lights, shadows, and objects. The plots and
                stories of the Expressionist films often dealt with madness, insanity, betrayal and other "intellectual"
                topics triggered by the experiences of World War I. Films like The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920),
                Nosferatu (1922) and M (1931) had a large international influence that can still be recognised in the
                works of current filmmakers, game designers and artists.[93] <br><br>

                Movies like Metropolis (1927) and Woman in the Moon (1929) partly created the genre of science fiction
                films[94] and Lotte Reiniger became a pioneer in animation, producing animated feature films like The
                Adventures of Prince Achmed, the oldest surviving and oldest European made animated movie.</td>

                <td><p style="font-size: larger; color: black; font-weight: bold;">"Film theory" seeks to develop concise and systematic concepts that apply to the study of film as art. The
                    concept of film as an art-form began in 1911 with Ricciotto Canudo's manifest The Birth of the Sixth Art.
                    The Moscow Film School, the oldest film school in the world, was founded in 1919, in order to teach about
                    and research film theory. Formalist film theory, led by Rudolf Arnheim, Béla Balázs, and Siegfried Kracauer,
                    emphasized how film differed from reality and thus could be considered a valid fine art. André Bazin reacted
                    against this theory by arguing that film's artistic essence lay in its ability to mechanically reproduce
                    reality, not in its differences from reality, and this gave rise to realist theory. More recent analysis
                    spurred by Jacques Lacan's psychoanalysis and Ferdinand de Saussure's semiotics among other things has given
                    rise to psychoanalytic film theory, structuralist film theory, feminist film theory, and others. On the
                    other hand, critics from the analytical philosophy tradition, influenced by Wittgenstein, try to clarify
                    misconceptions used in theoretical studies and produce analysis of a film's vocabulary and its link to a
                    form of life.</p></td>
