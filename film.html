    <p style="color: black; font-size: larger; background-color: blanchedalmond;">Sri Lankan cinema encompasses the Sri
        Lankan film industry. It is a fledgling industry that has struggled to find a footing since its inauguration in
        1947 with Kadawunu Poronduwa produced by S. M. Nayagam of Chitra Kala Movietone. Sri Lankan films are usually
        made in Sinhala and Tamil, the dominant languages of the country. <br><br>

        During the first decade, most films were made in neighboring Southern India and closely followed the conventions
        of Indian cinema. Studio shooting was the norm, with Indian style sets erected in film studios. It is widely
        believed that Rekava, made in 1956 by pioneer director Lester James Peries, was the first Sinhala film to be
        shot completely out of studio, however, it was the film "Gambada Sundari", starring Kingsley Jayasekera and
        Sheela Peiris in 1950, which was the first film shot outside studios instead. It was also the first Sri Lankan
        film where, like in "Rekava", the dialog was recorded on the spot. This was because the film was shot on 16mm,
        using an Auricon sound-on-film camera which recorded the sound on the 16mm film optically, unlike in the case of
        where the sound was recorded on a Kinevox 35mm magnetic recorder. The film was later 'blown-up' to 35mm and was
        screened in Colombo in 1950. <br><br>

        Though "Rekava" was acclaimed by local and international critics, the film failed to find an audience in the
        country and was a box office failure. Films continued to follow formulaic storylines borrowed from India up
        through the early 1960s despite such efforts as Sandesaya and Kurulu Bedda. <br><br>

        In 1964, Lester James Peries again contributed to the development of Sri Lankan cinema with Gamperaliya which
        was the first Sinhala film to feature no songs and like Rekava shot completely outside the studio. The camera
        work of William Blake garnered massive praise for portraying Sinhalese culture in a realistic manner and was
        hailed by critics[who?] and audiences alike. The producer Anton Wicremasinghe was awarded the Silver Peacock at
        the New Delhi International Film Festival for Gamperaliya. Following this breakthrough, several artistic Sinhala
        films were made in the late 1960s, including Sath Samudura by professor Siri Gunasinghe, supported by
        cinematography by Dr. D. B. Nihalsinghe. <br><br>

        During the 1970s, several talents came to the forefront, while commercial cinema continued to lift storylines
        and plots from Indian films. These include Dr. D.B. Nihalsingha with "Weilkatara"- Sri Lanka's first film in
        Cinemascope wide screen in 1972, and Vasantha Obeysekera who followed up his well-received debut Ves Gatho with
        a slew of successful films culminating with Palangetiyo in 1979. Another major director who stepped forward
        during this time is Dharmasena Pathiraja who examined the tensions of city youth in such works as Bambaru Awith
        and Ahas Gauwa. Artist and poet Mahagama Sekera's sole film Thun Man Handiya is also an important film in Sri
        Lankan cinema, released in 1970. Sumitra Peries, also struck out during the 1970s and she made films until 2023
        with work that looked at the conflicting roles of women in society. Her works include Gehenu Lamai, Sakman
        Maluwa, Vaishnavee and Ganga Addara. <br><br>

        Over the next few decades, artists such as Tissa Abeysekara, Chandran Rutnam, Dr. D.B. Nihalsingha, Udayakantha
        Warnasooriya, H.D.Premaratne, Ashoka Handagama, Prasanna Vithanage, Vimukthi Jayasundara, Anomaa Rajakaruna and
        Inoka Sathyangani have attempted to breathe new life into the industry. Nihalsingha was an accomplished
        cinematographer as well as an editor, so his films had an input that was special and brought a viewpoint to all
        of them, most of which focused on exploited women. <br> <br>

        Vithanage's film Purahanda Kaluwara is widely considered[by whom?] one of the best movies made in Sri Lanka as
        is Jayasundara's Sulanga Enu Pinisa which won the coveted Camera d'Or for best first film at the 2005 Cannes
        Film Festival. br 
        <br>

        During the Sri Lankan Civil War, several films began to tackle gritty subjects such as family relationships,
        abortion, and the results of the conflict between the military and Tamil Tigers in the north. Director Asoka
        Handagama especially drawn criticism for pursuing such material in his work. <br> <br>

        In the recent years, high-budget films like Aloko Udapadi, Aba (film) and Maharaja Gemunu based on Sinhalese
        epic historical stories have gained huge success. Furthermore, following the drastic impact on the film industry
        by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Adaraneeya Prarthana has emerged as one of the highest-grossing films of 2022. <br><br>
